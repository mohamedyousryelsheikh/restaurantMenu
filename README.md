# restaurantMenu

# Features Done:
- Listed items and categories from JSON file
- Add,edit and delete new categories to an array 
- static login to the admin page (username:admin,password:1234)

# development:
development is done using bootstrap,javascript and Angular,HTML and CSS

# NOTES:
- changed the naming of the json file
- there is an error at the json file format.. JSON file wasn't valid
- nodeJS has to be installed on the machine
- run npm init to create node_modules directory
- run npm install angular-route to install routing
- newly added categories are added in separate array not at the JSON file cause managing this needed time to handle and managing this through reading and writing in local file won't be a real scenario
